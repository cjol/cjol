<p>
	When I was 9, there was a TV show called Smile. Alongside the show, there was a website with games. To encourage viewers
	to play their games, prizes were awarded for high scores. Like any 9 year-old gamer, I yearned for the top spot, but the
	game was too much of a grind. Levels did not increase in difficulty, and the high score simply went to the child with the
	most patience. That was not me.
</p>
<p>
	Instead, I spotted that there was a simple pattern to the movement of enemies, and used AutoHotKey to write my very
	first program. The program played the game on my behalf, happily dodging all enemies. I left the program running overnight,
	and nabbed the first place spot. Content, I moved on with my life.
</p>
	Almost two years later, the BBC called me. They had just got round to processing the results from this game, and invited
	me to appear on the show as a prize. Thus began my life as a celebrity.
