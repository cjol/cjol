	<p>
		May Balls at Cambridge are exciting things. Thousands of people each pay over Â£100 per ticket, leading to huge spikes of demand on the servers processing tickets.
		Despite this, they are organised by non-technical committees. I built Mabel to help these non-technical users to run their own ticketing system -- built to handle
		all the ideosyncracies of May Ball ticketing -- without needing to worry about it crashing after launch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Free hosting for these kinds of purposes is provided by the Student-run Computing Facility, which dictated my choice of stack. MySQL is used for
		data storage, though I chose to use Node rather than the preferred PHP. For particularly large events, I deployed Mabel across a multicore cluster on AWS,
		behind an NGINX proxy used for load balancing.
	</p>
	`,
	"codeDescription": `Tickets for these events often run out within seconds, which means that there is a very real risk of race conditions.
	Rather than block execution to provide consistency, I came up with a way to take advantage of MySQL's natural per-query atomicity. By combining
	both the check for available tickets with the actual insertion into a single query, we can be sure that the view will be consistent. I am
	particularly proud of this SQL query!`,
